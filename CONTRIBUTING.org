**** Examples
#+begin_src git-commit
refactor!: Merge `Map` into `Texture`

The distinction was not useful in actual code and added code smell
and API design overhead due to all of the explicit matching required.

It also Simplifies Python FFI.

BREAKING CHANGE: Merge `Map` into `Texture`
# ^ this is optional if you put ! after the type ^

Fixes #123
#+end_src

#+begin_src git-commit
